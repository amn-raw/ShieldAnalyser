### 2. **Manual Experiment Creation** ✅
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What was added:**
- "Create New Experiment" button in upload section
- Modal dialog for configuration
- Input fields for:
  - Experiment name
  - Number of locations
  - Number of frequency points

**Workflow:**
1. User clicks "➕ Create New Experiment"
2. Modal appears with form
3. User enters:
   - Name: e.g., "Test Shield A"
   - Locations: e.g., 4
   - Frequencies: e.g., 10
4. System creates:
   - Empty table structure
   - Columns: Frequency, Reference, L1, L1-Shielding, L2, L2-Shielding, etc.
   - Rows: Initialized with default frequencies (100, 200, 300...)
5. Experiment immediately opens for editing

**Technical details:**
- POST to `/api/experiments/create` endpoint
- Auto-generates paired location/shielding columns
- Default frequencies increment by 100 MHz
- All values start at 0

---

### 3. **Add Row Functionality** ✅
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What was added:**
- "➕ Add Row" button in data section
- Automatic row creation
- Smart frequency incrementing

**How it works:**
1. User clicks "➕ Add Row"
2. System finds last frequency value
3. Creates new row with frequency + 100 MHz
4. Initializes all other columns to 0
5. Table and charts update immediately

**Features:**
- No limit on rows
- Shielding columns auto-calculate when values entered
- Charts update automatically
- Works for any experiment (uploaded or created)

**Technical details:**
- Client-side implementation
- Uses currentExperimentData
- Appends to data array
- Triggers displayExperimentData() and displayCharts()

---

### 4. **Add Column Functionality** ✅
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What was added:**
- "➕ Add Column" button in data section
- Modal dialog for column configuration
- Automatic shielding column pairing

**Workflow:**
1. User clicks "➕ Add Column"
2. Modal appears asking for column name
3. User enters name (e.g., "L5", "Front_Panel", "Side_Wall")
4. System creates TWO columns:
   - Location column (user's name)
   - Shielding column (name + "-Shielding")
5. All existing rows updated with default values (0)
6. Shielding effectiveness calculated: Reference - Location

**Features:**
- Duplicate name detection
- Automatic shielding column creation
- All rows updated consistently
- Charts update automatically
- Custom names supported (not just "L1", "L2")

**Technical details:**
- Inserts columns at end of array
- Updates all rows in data array
- Calculates initial shielding effectiveness
- Validation prevents duplicate names

---

### 5. **Delete Row Functionality** ✅
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What was added:**
- 🗑️ Delete button in Actions column (every row)
- Confirmation dialog
- Safety check (can't delete last row)

**How it works:**
1. User clicks 🗑️ button on a row
2. Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure?"
3. If confirmed:
   - Row removed from data
   - Table refreshes
   - Charts update
4. User reminded to save changes

**Safety features:**
- Cannot delete if only one row remains
- Confirmation required (prevents accidents)
- Clear feedback message

**Technical details:**
- Uses Array.splice() to remove row
- Validates data.length before deletion
- Updates display immediately
- Changes persist only after save

---

### 6. **Real-time Shielding Calculation** ✅
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What was enhanced:**
- Auto-recalculation when Reference changes
- Auto-recalculation when Location changes
- Immediate feedback in table
- Input fields update automatically

**How it works:**
```
When user edits Reference or Location:
1. Detect which column changed
2. If Reference → recalculate ALL shielding columns for that row
3. If Location → recalculate THAT location's shielding
4. Update input field values
5. Formula: Shielding = Reference - Location
```

**Example:**
```
Original:
Freq: 100, Ref: -20, L1: -40, L1-Shield: 20

User changes Ref to -25:
Freq: 100, Ref: -25, L1: -40, L1-Shield: 25 ← Auto-updated!

User changes L1 to -50:
Freq: 100, Ref: -25, L1: -50, L1-Shield: 25 ← Auto-updated!
```

**Technical details:**
- Enhanced updateCell() function
- Finds reference column dynamically
- Loops through all shielding columns
- Updates both data model and DOM

---

### 7. **UI Enhancements** ✅
**Status:** Fully Implemented

**What was added:**

**Modal Dialogs:**
- Create Experiment modal
- Add Column modal
- Professional styling with animations
- Click outside to close
- X button to close

**Action Buttons:**
