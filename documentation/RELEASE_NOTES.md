4. Examine both visualizations
5. Try editing a value and saving
6. Download the processed Excel file

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I add more users?**
A: Edit `creds.json` and add user objects:
```json
{
  "users": [
    {"username": "newuser", "password": "newpass"}
  ]
}
```

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: All experiments are saved in `experiments.json` in the project directory.

**Q: Can I change the port?**
A: Yes, edit `main.py` and change the port in `uvicorn.run()`:
```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)
```

**Q: How do I backup my data?**
A: Copy `experiments.json` to a safe location:
```bash
cp experiments.json backup_experiments.json
```

## üêõ Known Issues

### Limitations
1. **Storage**: JSON-based (not suitable for very large datasets)
2. **Concurrency**: No multi-user edit conflict resolution
3. **File Size**: Very large Excel files may be slow
4. **Authentication**: Basic auth only (no OAuth/SAML)

### Workarounds
1. **Large Datasets**: Split into multiple experiments
2. **Concurrent Edits**: Use single-user workflow or coordination
3. **Large Files**: Pre-process to reduce size
4. **Advanced Auth**: Can be added in future versions
